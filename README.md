# Fitness Tracker

## Tracking accurate fitness to promote motivation and active living


I plan to design a user interface where users can track their fitness activities throughout the week. 
The project will be able to give you:
- Target calories per workout
- Exercises to be completed 
- Reps of each exercise and time allocated 

The project will show you a calendar of the week and which day you will be hitting legs and arms etc...
Users will be able to input:
- the number of days they want to exercise per week
- time per workout 
And the project will project workouts for sepcific days and which exercises to be completed. 

The target audience is adults and young adults who put off going to the gym. If exercises are planned in your schedule, it is hard to refuse going. This project interests me because in first year, I find myself putting off the gym because im too 'busy' when in reality I didn't schedule a time to go. I believe if I scheduled it, I would have incentive to go and stay active. 

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to add an exercise to my schedule and specify the name, calories burned, number of reps, and time it will take
- As a user, I want to be able to see the list of workouts I need to complete for the week
- As a user, I want to be able to remove a workout from the list
- As a user, I want to be able to set leg days and arm days and have the exercises change accordingly
- As a user, I want to have the option to save my weekly schedule to file
- As a user, I want to be able to be able to load my weekly schedule from file

# Instructions for End User

- You can generate the first required action related to the user story "adding multiple Xs to a Y" by pressing Actions in the top left corner then clicking "add an exercise", after that you can follow the instructions to add an exercise to the weekly planner. If you want to add multiple, keep repeating this process. 
- You can generate the second required action related to the user story "adding multiple Xs to a Y" by pressing "add type day" in the Actions menu. This delegates a specific type (leg or arm) to a day so the code will add leg exercise types or arm exercise tyeps accordingly. You can see the set days when you press "see current schedule".
- You can locate my visual component by clicking the button "Get some motivation" at the bottom of the screen after you've clicked load or start new. 
- You can save the state of my application by pressing the "Save to File" button at the bottom of the user screen.
- You can reload the state of my application by pressing "Load from file" at the very beginning of the program. After you saved it, you can rerun the program and click this button again for updated changes.
