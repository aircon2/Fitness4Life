# Fitness Tracker

## Tracking accurate fitness to promote motivation and active living


I plan to design a user interface where users can track their fitness activities throughout the week. 
The project will be able to give you:
- Target calories per workout
- Exercises to be completed 
- Reps of each exercise and time allocated 

The project will show you a calendar of the week and which day you will be hitting legs and arms etc...
Users will be able to input:
- the number of days they want to exercise per week
- time per workout 
And the project will project workouts for sepcific days and which exercises to be completed. 

The target audience is adults and young adults who put off going to the gym. If exercises are planned in your schedule, it is hard to refuse going. This project interests me because in first year, I find myself putting off the gym because im too 'busy' when in reality I didn't schedule a time to go. I believe if I scheduled it, I would have incentive to go and stay active.
